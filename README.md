## Overview
Landing page with my main professional information. Made deliberately with just HTML5 and CSS3. 
As a personal challenge, I will not to use any JavaScript at all on this project. Why? Because I want to sharpen my CSS animation skills. I also want to avoid relying so much on JS for problems that can be resolved with just markup and stylesheets.
