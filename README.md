## Overview
Landing page with my main professional information. Made deliberately with just HTML5 and CSS3. 
As a personal challenge, I will not to use any JavaScript at all on this project. Why? Because I want to sharpen my CSS animation skills. I also want to avoid relying so much on JS for problems that can be resolved with just markup and stylesheets.

## Updates
7/3/2019 
- Main version is ready
- Next phase: add animations and transitions. Add credit for the resources used. Add a new section with some project links
